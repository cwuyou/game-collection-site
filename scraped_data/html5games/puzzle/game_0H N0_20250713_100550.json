  "description": "Similar to game classics like Minesweeper, your goal in the logic puzzle 0h n0 is to figure out how many blue and red dots are on the field. The rules are simple: blue dots can see others in their own row and column, their numbers indicate how many. Red dots always block their view. Solve the puzzle and find all the dots' correct position to complete the grid in this challenging brain teaser!",
